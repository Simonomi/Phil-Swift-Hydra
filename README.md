# Phil Swift Hydra
A virus that turns Phil Swift into a hydra. In other words, there's a photo of phil swift on your desktop, and every time you delete it, it multiplies. There are two versions, a visual basic version, and an executable (.exe). The visual basic has multiple photos of Phil Swift, while the executable has one (for now), but the executable is easier to use.

## Instructions for executable
1. To use on current user, just run the file normally and it should copy itself to the startup folder and run automatically
2. To use on different user, put the file in their startup folder: _C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup_

### Notes:
* The image used is stored at _C:\ProgramData\Hydra_ once the program is run, feel free to change it!
* When recompiling, delete both _.exe_'s, compile _hydra.ahk_, then _Installer.ahk_
* Current update/bug fix list:
	* Add variety update, so instead of only one image, they are randomly generated
